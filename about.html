            <p>
              For 20 years I have been a business manager and chef, winning many awards from local publications, but I
              was
              never satisfied with the work.
              Working for smaller companies, I discovered that I really enjoyed certain artistic and technical aspects
              of
              the job, such as <strong>graphic and web design</strong>.
              Eventually I became curious about <strong>coding</strong> and began learning python.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a student at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thinkful.com/"><strong>Thinkful</strong></a>, I am
              genuinely excited to be on a path to a career in software development,
              and I am looking forward to working with a team to create something amazing.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I am not coding I am usually creating vivid illustrations with software like Adobe Illustrator or
              Procreate. I also really enjoy astronomy/astrophysics and reading about
              the latest discoveries or newest technologies in the field.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am a quick-study, committed and creative, and it would be awesome to connect with like-minded developers
              or
              even potential employers. Reach out, and
              let's change the world, one block of code at a time!
