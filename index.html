                Hi, my name is Frank Costelli, and I am full-stack software
                developer living in sunny Saint Petersburg, Florida!
              </p>
              <p>
                I really enjoy working with JavaScript, Node.js, HTML, CSS,
                Python, and various frameworks/libraries such as Bootstrap,
                React, and Django. I am also proficient in vector illustration
                and graphic design, specifically Adobe software such as
                Illustrator and Photoshop.

                For 20 years I have been a business manager and chef, winning
                many awards from local publications, but I was never satisfied
                with the work. Working for smaller companies, I discovered that
                I really enjoyed certain artistic and technical aspects of the
                job, such as <strong>graphic and web design</strong>. Eventually
                I became curious about <strong>coding</strong> and began
                learning JavaScript and Python.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a student at

                  ><strong>Thinkful</strong></a
                >, I am genuinely excited to be on a path to a career in
                software development, and I am looking forward to working with a
                team to create something amazing.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I am not coding I am usually creating vivid illustrations
                with software like Adobe Illustrator or Procreate. I also really
                enjoy astronomy/astrophysics and reading about the latest
                discoveries or newest technologies in the field.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am a quick-study, committed and creative, and it would be
                awesome to connect with like-minded developers or even potential
                employers. Reach out, and let's change the world, one block of
                code at a time!

            <h3>Local Library</h3>
            <p class="black-box">
              This project required the creation of a dashboard for a local
              library, which show which books were available, which are
              currently borrowed, as well as other useful statistics. This was a
              front-stack project using mostly native JavaScript. Building the
              dashboard was a great excersize in the use of higher-functions.

              The decoder ring project was a front-end development project using
              JavaScript to create ciphers that will allow someone to encode or
              decode messages. It was a great problem solving project, and good
              practice with string manipulation. You can find the repo with the

            <h3>Space Invader's Clone</h3>
            <p class="black-box">
              This was a fun side-project, attempting to build a clone of the
              classic arcade game "Space Invaders". This application was built
              with Python, using the Pygame library. It was a great excersize in
              game logic and event listeners. Check out the code

            <h3>Calculator App</h3>
            <p class="black-box">
              Building a basic calculator with Python was an interesting
              excersize in working with native Python GUI modules, such as
              Tkinter. I was able to get a beginners understanding as to how a
              GUI is wired up to the applications functions. I was also
              introduced to concepts such as click/key events and lambda
              functions. Check out the
